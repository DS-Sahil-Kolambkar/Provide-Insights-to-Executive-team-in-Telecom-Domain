# Provide-Insights-to-Executive-team-in-Telecom-Domain

This is my submission for #codebasicsresumeprojectchallenge .I have used different approach for solving this challenge. I tried to create a dashboard using python. I have used HoloViz-maintained libraries:

1.Panel -A high-level app and dashboarding solution for Python
2.hvPlot- A familiar and high-level API for data exploration and visualization

To open dashboard use following steps:
1. Download ipynb file from the repository and run it in jupyter notebook or jupyterLabs
2. Open Anaconda Prompt(coding) from start menu
3. Enter panel serve [.ipnb filename] 
4.Run it. You will get following output

5. copy http://localhost address and run it in a new tab in browser
